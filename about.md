# Fancy Player

This mod allows you to color your particles and dash fire, overriding the game's default colors. Everything is inside the mod settings. There's also an optional cosmetic setting for those who use emitter type 1 (radius) for their player particles.

Serving suggestion: I match the dash fire and particle colors with my glow color
