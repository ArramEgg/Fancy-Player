# Fancy Player

This mod allows you to color your particles and dash fire, overriding the games default colors. Everything is inside the mod settings. There's also an optional cosmetic setting for those who use emitter type 1 (radius) for their player particles.

Note: this is not a fading RGB icons mod :p

Serving suggestion: I match the dash fire and particle colors with my glow color
